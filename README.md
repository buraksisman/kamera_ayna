# 📷 DIY Webcam Mirror Mount for Educators

## Overview
This is a simple, 3D-printable apparatus designed for **educators and teachers** who conduct distance education via platforms like **Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or Google Meet** and need to **show physical materials** (books, drawings, tools, etc.) on camera.

By using a **small mirror mounted on this apparatus**, teachers can turn their laptop webcam into a **makeshift document camera**, allowing them to share handwritten notes, sketches, and physical materials during a live session — without requiring expensive additional hardware.

## Features
- 🧠 Simple design for easy printing and assembly  
- 🖨️ Fully 3D-printable using standard home or school 3D printers  
- 📦 Compact and portable  
- 🔧 No permanent mounting — simply **place it on top of your laptop screen** in front of the webcam  
- 🪞 Compatible with **mini mirrors** available from local hardware or craft stores  

## How It Works
1. **3D print** the provided STL file(s).
2. **Attach** a small mirror to the holder using glue or double-sided tape.
3. **Place the apparatus on your laptop screen**, with the mirror facing the webcam.
4. Tilt the mirror as needed to reflect downward toward the material you want to show.
5. Start your video conferencing tool and share what you write, sketch, or demonstrate under the camera.
